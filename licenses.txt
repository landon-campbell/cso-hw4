(GPL) GNU General Public License
- Requires that any derivative work is also licensed under the GPL, which ensures that the source code 
is always available to the public, even if it is modified or derived.
- This license is often used for open-source software, and it is one of the most popular licenses for 
free software, but I decided against it because it requires that users make their code open-source.

(MIT) License
- License that allows users to do almost anything with the code, including modification and distribution.
- I will choose this license because it allows me do how I see fit with the software, it is short and simple, and any authorized users can use this library without additional issues.
- It also have the name MIT in it, which is cool I guess.

(Apache) License 2.0
- License that allows users to do almost anything with the code, including modification and distribution. This license is unique to those above because it
includes a patent license, which protects users from patent lawsuits.
- I decided against this license because it is more complex than the MIT License, and I do not want to deal with the extra complexity.
